# Privacy Policy for Xmoji

**Last updated:** February 19, 2026

## Overview

Xmoji is a Chrome extension that adds Slack-style emoji shortcode support to X (Twitter). Your privacy matters, and this extension was built with that in mind.

## Data Collection

Xmoji does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Period.

## What the Extension Stores Locally

Xmoji uses Chrome's built-in `chrome.storage.local` API to save the following on your device:

- **Your preferences** — whether the extension and autocomplete are enabled or disabled
- **Custom shortcodes** — any custom emoji shortcode mappings you create
- **Usage frequency** — which emoji you use most often, so they appear first in suggestions

This data never leaves your browser. There are no servers, no analytics, no tracking.

## Permissions Explained

- **Storage** — to save your preferences and custom shortcodes locally
- **Host access to x.com and twitter.com** — to detect shortcodes as you type and show the autocomplete popup. The extension only runs on these two sites and does not access any other websites.

## Third Parties

Xmoji does not share any data with third parties. There are no ads, no analytics services, and no external network requests.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy changes, it will be updated here with a new date at the top.
